        "You’re on the verge of a promising digital transformation journey. But where do you start? To improve your asset performance, you must first plot out the foundational principles of asset management. Before you know how to allocate your assets, you must know exactly what assets you have and what their characteristics are. This starting point assumes that your employees can find equipment in need of modification, repair, or preventive maintenance. It also assumes your workforce is familiar with warehouse and procurement catalogs to find the right parts for every job.<br /><br />Once you have taken inventory and defined all of your assets, it’s time to put in an allocation system that will serve as a central backbone.<br /><br />Allocation in this sense means a digital reflection of your plant and all the systems you use to manage maintenance and engineering work, as well as the regulations surrounding them. The best solution is to create a single digital source that acts as a hub for all information (parts, drawings, documentation, preventive plans, safety protocols, critical control point, etc.). This hub acts as a “digital twin” of your plant, mirroring your asset design and engineering processes.<br /><br />Even if achieving faster response times is your top priority, performing proper asset care to bring equipment back online merits a deeper look into which fundamental elements are lacking or underestimated. Understanding these root causes enables you to improve overall asset performance and meet your peers’ benchmark levels.<br /><br />A thorough, in-person assessment of your foundational elements will help you find the most pressing information and allocation gaps."
