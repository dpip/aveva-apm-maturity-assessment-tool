        "<h3 class='results-title'>Take your asset performance to the next level.</h3>You’re on the verge of a promising digital transformation journey. But where do you start? To improve your asset performance, you must first plot out the foundational principles of asset management. Before you know how to allocate your assets, you must know exactly what assets you have and what their characteristics are. This starting point assumes that your employees can find equipment in need of modification, repair, or preventive maintenance. It also assumes your workforce is familiar with warehouse and procurement catalogs to find the right parts for every job.<br /><br />Once you have taken inventory and defined all of your assets, it’s time to put in an allocation system that will serve as a central backbone.<br /><br />Allocation in this sense means a digital reflection of your plant and all the systems you use to manage maintenance and engineering work, as well as the regulations surrounding them. The best solution is to create a single digital source that acts as a hub for all information (parts, drawings, documentation, preventive plans, safety protocols, critical control point, etc.). This hub acts as a “digital twin” of your plant, mirroring your asset design and engineering processes.<br /><br />Even if achieving faster response times is your top priority, performing proper asset care to bring equipment back online merits a deeper look into which fundamental elements are lacking or underestimated. Understanding these root causes enables you to improve overall asset performance and meet your peers’ benchmark levels.<br /><br />A thorough, in-person assessment of your foundational elements will help you find the most pressing information and allocation gaps.",
        "<h3 class='results-title'>Find and close your performance gaps.</h3>At this level, you likely rely on an integrated system that houses data on everything that’s a part of your plant. With it, your organization can answer core asset management questions around financials and performance aspects related to equipment conditions. Every engineering project should be completed within 115% of its budget and timeline, with the information package and operating procedures handed over smoothly to operations and maintenance teams.<br /></br />Still, your organization may struggle to answer deeper questions on asset condition, work spectrum, root causes of budget overruns and unexpected or repetitive losses, and the effectiveness of preventive maintenance and repairs on key assets. There’s still room to improve preventive tasks, shutdown efficiencies, and planned downtime. You may further investigate which of the most time-intensive jobs could be eliminated or replaced.<br /></br />How can you ensure your operations run like a well-oiled machine? How can you improve data quality and system usage, transform culture, and streamline roles for more effective workflows? How can you achieve the highest levels of employee productivity?<br />Your organization still has the potential to achieve higher performance. To better understand that potential, a step-change plan to scope the right conditions for your digitalization initiative is the best course of action. Our more in-depth, in-person APM Assessment can identify gaps in efficiency and help you determine how to address them.<br /></br />",
        "<h3 class='results-title'>Build a path to organizational excellence.</h3>You’re on a path to organizational excellence, with the potential to grow into the highest quartile of performance and maturity benchmarks. You likely combine experience, OEM recommendations, and actual performance metrics to evaluate risk. Your employees use the same system for core workflows, and you maintain all key data and job registrations in that system to keep your asset performance on target.<br /><br />Collaboration between departments is on point and integrated planning with maintenance planners and supervisors is standard. Safety, quality, and key business objectives are at the core of your organization—driving business processes, data management, and behaviors.<br /><br />Enhancing operations at your level means combining all information sources and operational approaches to make your data models “round” and dynamic. By combining all of your data, from technical drawings to automation tags and lubrication checklists to preventive and prescriptive maintenance tasks, you will create a reliable “digital twin” that acts as a single source of truth. Whether bolted to the factory floor or anchored to the bottom of the sea, the design and engineering phase of your operation will have one hub from which to pull actionable data.<br /><br />Live performance data also improves your capacity to prevent failures and to prescribe mitigating actions in advance. AI technology can bring hidden anomalies to the surface, helping your workforce identify the correct measures at the right times, preventing failures and unplanned downtime. Augmented reality and handheld devices can also drive your On Time in Full KPIs further.<br /><br />Because your organization can handle higher levels of complexity, it can also be a challenge to discover exactly where your improvement potential for the short and long-term is hiding. It can be daunting to investigate processes, data flows, organizational roles, and behaviors—and then communicate that story to the boardroom. Our more in-depth, in-person APM Assessment can help you with this challenge, giving you the tools to see your assets in end-to-end detail.<br /></br>",
        "<h3 class='results-title'>Raise the industry bar.</h3>Congratulations! Your organization is likely performing in the top quartile of its industry in terms of organizational alignment, optimized asset performance, and overall business benchmark. You have put incredible effort into streamlining work processes, role profiles, system configurations, and data models.<br /><br />With these methodologies in place, the boardroom can confidently present mission statements and company strategies that integrate the asset performance management topics you have prioritized.<br /><br />But are you keeping up with the latest digital industry technologies? As we all know, they are developed and deployed at an unbelievable pace, so staying aware of them can be a challenge.<br /><br />Our more detailed, in-person APM Assessment can help you find potential future deployment challenges and obstacles across different facilities, asset types, and organizational subcultures. By looking ahead now, you can ensure that you stay on top tomorrow.<br /><br />"
